> This is the “interview-ready” story: what happened, why it matters, what you’d do next.

## Executive summary
- **Total purchasers:** [REPLACE_ME]
- **D1 retention (weighted):** [REPLACE_ME]%
- **D7 retention (weighted):** [REPLACE_ME]%
- **Top revenue category:** [REPLACE_ME]
- **Notable anomaly:** view spike on [REPLACE_ME_DATE]

## Retention insights (Page 2)
### What we observed
- Retention drops sharply after Day 1 and stabilizes into a long tail.
- Cohorts vary: some purchase dates retain better than others.

### Why it matters
- Indicates strong “one-time purchase” behavior.
- Opportunity: build post-purchase reactivation or replenishment journeys.

### What I would do next
- Break down retention by category or price band.
- Identify repeat purchase products.

## Funnel insights (Pages 1 & 3)
### What we observed
- Biggest drop-off appears at: [REPLACE_ME: view→cart OR cart→purchase]
- Daily CVRs show: [REPLACE_ME: stable / volatile / affected by spike]

### Why it matters
- If view→cart is weak: product page/UX, pricing, trust signals.
- If cart→purchase is weak: checkout friction, shipping surprises, payment failures.

### What I would do next
- Segment CVR by device, category, and price range (if available).
- Investigate abandonment points (if additional fields exist).

## Revenue driver insights (Page 3)
### What we observed
- Revenue is concentrated in a few categories.
- Scatter quadrant analysis identifies:
  - High traffic + low CVR → optimization opportunities
  - Low traffic + high CVR → growth opportunities

### Recommended actions
- Optimize low CVR high traffic categories (better PDP, promos, reviews).
- Scale acquisition for high CVR categories.
- Improve merchandising for categories with strong cart→purchase but weak view→cart.

## Trends & diagnostics insights (Page 4)
### What we observed
- A major **view spike** occurred on [REPLACE_ME_DATE], with spike magnitude [REPLACE_ME]% vs baseline.
- Conversion did/did not rise proportionally.

### Interpretation
- If views spike without conversion: likely low-intent traffic, bot traffic, or irrelevant campaign targeting.
- If conversion rises too: campaign success, stock availability, strong demand.

### What I would do next
- Verify spike source (marketing channel attribution if available).
- Check category composition during the spike.

## Final takeaway
This dashboard provides a complete view of:
- “How users convert” (funnel)
- “How users return” (retention)
- “What drives revenue” (categories/brands)
- “What changed over time” (trends + anomaly)
